# InteractiveCondo
Interactive Condo allows home buyers to experience a photo-realistic version of a modern condo home. Using the latest lighting and rendering tools, users can configure furniture, products, materials, & lighting and get a truly immersive experience using the standard desktop mode or virtual reality.

The goal for Interactive Condo is to enhance the home buying experience by bridging the gap between reality & virtual reality by allowing the home buyer to truly feel like they just stepped into a brand new home.
